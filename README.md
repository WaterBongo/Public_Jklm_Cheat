# JKLM Bot

This Script Is used to connect to a web game called [JKLM.FUN](https://www.jklm.fun)
This Scipt I have coded is meant to be used as a bot on jklm.fun Bombparty. It establishes a Websocket connection to their server to send information, When connected I am able to send actions within the game such as joining a round, sending a word when its my turn or sending a message. When it is the bots turn said bot will autmatically find a word from my word dictionary and play the word.

## What Did I Learn?
By starting and creating this project, I learned how to use recieve and send with websockets(wss). When starting with this project I had no prior knowledge with websockets. But after many attempts and countless hours spent, I believe I now know quite well on websockets and how to use them.
